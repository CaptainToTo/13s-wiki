1. ## Prep your machiine
Before you begin, make sure that you have downloaded the ubuntu image for your class and your architecture. For **Spring 2023 CSE13s** This is ubuntu 22.10 x68_64 (also called amd64) or ubuntu 22.10 arm64. 

- If you have an Apple silicon mac (M1, M2, etc), You will need to use the arm64 versions.
- If you have a Intel/AMD windows computer, you will need the amd64 version. You will still need this if you have an Intel CPU
- If you have an Intel Mac, follow the windows instructions
- If your configuration is not one of these, please contact a Jess or TA during lab sections. 

You will also need quite a bit (probably 40gb) of free space. If you do not have any free space, make some now. 

2. ## Install your vm software

[For Apple Silicon mac users](mac)

[For Other systems](windows)


3. ## Install ubunutu



4. ## Install required sofware and setup

We now have a virtual machine, but while we *can* use it right now, there are many tools that we need for this class, and some tools that we can use to simplify this process. 
### Required tools:
This is *not* the definiative list of everything we need for this class. It is *only* what you need to get started with the first few assignments. As the class progresses, you will be given more software you will need to install. Thus, it is best that you familarize yourself with [unix commands](unix_commands)

- ssh
- git
- clang
- clang-format
-
